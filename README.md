I'm working on this project to ensure the office runs smoothly and to prevent health issues. I need to figure out who enjoys working in the office, who prefers working from home, and when people usually take sick days. The reason for having a hybrid job setup is to save money on renting a big building and to create fun events for employees to maintain a positive company culture. By understanding these preferences, the company can plan events at the office when most people are likely to be there and take precautions if many employees get sick. This way, the can keep things running smoothly and make sure everyone stays healthy and happy.
This project utilizes Power BI to provide a detailed analysis of employee attendance and presence metrics within an organization. The primary aim is to offer HR professionals comprehensive insights into workforce presence, aiding in effective decision-making regarding workforce management and policy implementation.
There are several indicators in the report that enhance its utility, making it easier to make data-driven decisions. These indicators include:

    Workforce Presence Analysis:
        WFH (Work from Home) Presence: Percentage of employees working from home, tracked over time.
        WFO (Work from Office) Presence: Percentage of employees working from the office, providing insights into office utilization.
        Absent Percentage: Tracking of absenteeism rates to identify trends and potential issues.

    Special Leave (SL) Presence:
        SL Presence: Percentage of employees on special leave, helping to understand leave patterns and manage workforce availability.

    Employee-specific Metrics:
        Individual Attendance: Detailed presence data for each employee, including WFH presence, WFO presence, and SL presence.
        Status Monitoring: Status updates for employees, such as presence on specific dates, to track daily attendance.

    Monthly Trends:
        Presence Percentage by Date: Visualization of WFO, WFH, and SL presence percentages on a monthly basis.
        Absenteeism and SL Count: Monthly counts of absences and special leaves, highlighting peaks and troughs in attendance.

    Comparative Analysis:
        Employee Comparison: Comparison of presence percentages among different employees to identify patterns and discrepancies.
        Monthly Performance: Comparative analysis of attendance data across different months to observe trends and seasonality.
