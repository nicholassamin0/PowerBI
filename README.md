I created this project that using Power BI to analyze and visualize key performance metrics within the hospitality domain. The primary objective is to provide comprehensive insights into various aspects of hotel performance, including revenue, occupancy rates, and booking trends, across multiple cities and hotel categories. 
There are several indicators in the report that enhance its utility, making it easier to make data-driven decisions. These indicators include:  

    Revenue Analysis:
        Total Revenue: Detailed breakdowns of revenue generated by different hotel properties across various weeks.
        Revenue by Category: Comparative analysis of business vs. luxury segments to identify trends and performance disparities.

    Performance Metrics:
        RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Calculation and visualization of revenue efficiency per room.
        ADR (Average Daily Rate): Insights into the average room rate charged over time.
        Occupancy Rates: Monitoring occupancy percentages to assess room utilization.

    Booking Statistics:
        Platform Performance: Analysis of bookings made through different platforms (e.g., logtrip, journey, direct online/offline).
        Booking Realization: Percentage of realized bookings out of total attempts, providing insights into platform efficiency.

    City-wise and Property-wise Performance:
        City Analysis: Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy rates for properties in key cities such as Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad.
        Property-Specific Metrics: Detailed performance indicators for individual hotel properties, enabling micro-level performance assessment.

    Weekly Trends:
        Revenue Trends by Week: Visualization of weekly revenue fluctuations, aiding in the identification of peak periods and off-peak trends.
        Key Metrics Over Time: Tracking the evolution of RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy rates week-by-week to uncover temporal trends.

    Operational Insights:
        Daily Room Statistics: Metrics such as Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN), Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN), and Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN) to evaluate operational efficiency.
        Cancellation Rates and Customer Ratings: Assessment of cancellation rates and average customer ratings to understand guest satisfaction and potential areas for improvement.
