I created this project to ensure that the manager can monitor the company's performance in selling products. The resulting report demonstrates how well each product has sold and identifies which cities have the highest sales. This information helps the manager prioritize focus areas, determining which products and cities require attention. Additionally, it supports making informed business decisions based on the current sales status.

This project aims to provide hotel managers with comprehensive, daily performance insights through Power BI. By leveraging SQL for data validation and extraction, the project ensures accurate and timely data is available for decision-making. The ultimate goal is to enable managers to make informed decisions quickly, influencing marketing strategies and operational structures for optimal performance.
